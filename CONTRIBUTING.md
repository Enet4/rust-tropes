This project is open to contributions of various forms, including more content, increased accuracy of said content, and style improvements.

If you feel that something is a trope worth having here, or wish to discuss a particular trope, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Enet4/rust-tropes/issues/new).

Pull requests proposing new entries or improvements to existing entries are also welcome. Pro tips:

- To add a new entry to the dictionary, create a Markdown file in the content folder. You may wish to follow the other examples in order to know which fields to fill in.
- To mention other entries, use the special `@/` wildcard to point to the other entry file. Example: `[toilet closure](@/toilet-closure.md)`
- Please prefer one pull request per entry, so that they can be reviewed individually.
- To test things locally, you can serve the site using [Zola](https://getzola.org).

```sh
zola serve
```
