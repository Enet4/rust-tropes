title = "Toilet Closure"
+++
`|_| ()`
A closure that takes one parameter and immediately drops it. Equivalent in behavior to [`std::mem::drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.drop.html). Named as such because it looks like a toilet (the flush tank and bowl) rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Despite `drop` being easier to type than the toilet closure, there is currently no community-wide consensus on whether one should write the former or the latter.
