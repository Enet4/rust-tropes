title = "Rust Evangelism Strike Force"
+++

Acronym: RESF

A movement of proponents of Rust, who usually talk to their peers about the benefits of the language, and may also be in favor of [rewriting existing software in Rust](@/rewrite-in-rust.md). As in all movements, different levels of adherence to the principles of the RESF exist, not all of which represent a healthy conduct. A zealous attitude may often be used for humor (see [/r/rustjerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustjerk)), but is not well regarded when taken seriously.
