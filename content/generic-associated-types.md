Acronym: GATs

A planned extension to Rust ([RFC1598](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1598-generic_associated_types.md)) which allows for lifetime parameters and type parameters in associated types of a trait.
Often referred to by its acronym, GATs are one of the features highly anticipated by some members of the community.
