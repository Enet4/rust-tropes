title = "Generic Associated Types"

Acronym: GATs

An extension to Rust ([RFC1598](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1598-generic_associated_types.md))
which allows for lifetime parameters and type parameters in associated types of a trait.
Often referred to by their acronym,
GATs were one of the features highly anticipated by some members of the community.

Five years after the RFC was approved,
a baseline implementation was finally made stable
in [version 1.65.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/11/03/Rust-1.65.0.html#generic-associated-types-gats).
