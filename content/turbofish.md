`::<>`

Turbofish, or _turbo fish_,
is the base syntax for defining type parameters explicitly
when using a generic type or function.

Although this syntax may seem verbose and largely unnecessary
given the prior art of type parameters,
the turbofish actually cannot be removed from the Rust language.
The proof of the turbofish's invencibility
has been written into a memorial:
the [_Bastion of the Turbofish_](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/43192ca3d72ed0ca42ba913137585219ba0a691f/src/test/ui/parser/bastion-of-the-turbofish.rs).
